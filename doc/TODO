 - event notification and log-parsing interface for plugins
 - interaction between plugins
 - rename trace functions to "tr_*" for easier debug breakpoints
 - add meta console command to debug indiv functions, like mm_trace can
 - catch register cmds/cvars from gameDLL and list then in "meta game"
 - in win32, doesn't report parsed plugin line properly; says only:
      [META] ini: Read plugin config for:
 - use scanf for file parsing ?
 - "meta cancel" command
 - more documentation info
 - don't refresh_ini on "quit"
 - test more bot support for metagame.ini

 - track "messages" for plugins and provide READ_* functions (usermsg.cpp)
 - provide other "engine" functions to plugins
	- is_connected
	- is_ingame

 x fix stat()-related code for linux only
 x remake MSVC project
   x use resources
   x doublecheck DLLEXPORT and stuff
 x txt files in "dos" format?
 x separate zip/tgz files
 x compat support for "admin.ini"
 x support dir-specific "metamod.ini" files, similar to servercfgfile
 x more documentation info: engineapi_info.txt
 x html view of source
 x handle RegUserMsg and allow lists of registered messages to be queried
   by bot plugins or other plugins that want to catch these things, and to
   allow these plugins to be loaded during a map (since after mapstart, the
   plugin can't catch RegUserMsg calls, since they've all already been made).
 x find some way to generally allow plugins to use LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS,
   without requiring explicit support in metamod
