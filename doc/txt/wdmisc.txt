WDMisc plugin
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is a simple plugin that I use as a testbed for various features and
other things I need to try from a plugin.

It currently provides two features:

   
  - a cvar "bounce" that, if set to 1, will exit the server at map change.
    I use this when I need to shutdown or the server, and don't want to
    kill it in the middle of a map, nor watch the server constantly until
    the timelimit expires.
   
  - it prints a centersay to all the players whenever someone in
    Counter-Strike plants the bomb. This was done basically as a
    proof-of-concept for catching certain game-events that aren't
    otherwise triggered by the HL API. It works only by examining every
    log message that the server generates, and checking to see if it
    includes the string indicating the particular event in question (in
    this case "Planted_The_Bomb").
   
    Although this works, it is really a rather POOR solution to the
    problem, as it assumes a LOT of string-compares, which can seriously
    degrade the performance of the server. I did try to take as many
    short-cuts as reasonable in the code, to decrease the amount of
    string-comparing going on, which makes the code a bit less readable
    than doing just a "strstr" on the log line.

Other features to be added/removed in the future...
