Release Notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Major changes with Metamod 1.17
===============================

  - New cvar "metamod_version" that can be queried from client game
    browsers.
   
  - New console commands available to clients (much like the existing
    server console commands):
   
      - "meta version" prints out version information (date, compile type,
        etc).
      - "meta list" shows a list of the plugins running on the server
        (name, author, version, etc).
   
  - New file config.ini to provide a more reliable and flexible method of
    specifying configuration options. At the moment, the recognized
    options mirror those from +localinfo, ie:
   
      - debuglevel <number>
      - gamedll <path>
      - plugins_file <path>
      - exec_cfg <path>
      - autodetect <yes/no>
      - clientmeta <yes/no>
   
    Default path is "addons/metamod/config.ini" but can be overridden with
    "+localinfo mm_configfile".
   
    Also, new console command "meta config" to display this information.
   
  - New console command "meta require" to force the server to exit if the
    specified plugin isn't loaded/running. Intended for use in server.cfg
    or metaexec.cfg, to keep the server from starting up if desired
    plugins don't load. For example:
   
      - meta require adminmod
      - meta require 1
   
    The former requires that a plugin with the substring "adminmod" is
    found loaded and running. The latter requires that the plugin in slot
    1 is loaded and running.
   
  - If an override gamedll is specified and found to be invalid or
    missing, Metamod will now exit with an appropriate error message,
    rather than just falling back to the auto-detected gamedll. This
    should provide more immediate and useful feedback, and help prevent
    some confusion.

Incompatible changes with Metamod 1.13
======================================

  - Config file metagame.ini is no longer supported. This file was
    deprecated in Metamod 1.08 (2001/06/16). Use instead the "+localinfo
    mm_gamedll" option.

Major changes with Metamod 1.13
===============================

  - New config file names and locations, per the Addon Development
    Standard rev 1.00, developed on the hlds_apps list.
   
    Default config file locations are now:
      - $gamedir/addons/metamod/plugins.ini
      - $gamedir/addons/metamod/exec.cfg
   
    Previous config file locations are also supported for backwards
    compability:
      - $gamedir/metamod.ini
      - $gamedir/metaexec.cfg
   
    Note that the pathnames in plugins.ini are unchanged, and are still
    relative to the gamedir.
